# Real-Time_wallpaper

This is a new WebGL project from scratch, a real-time wallpaper

## Overview

The purpose of the project is to create a dynamic real-time wallpaper for Mac and window users,
where it can display the light effect depending on the user's local time and weather information.

## Technologies Used

List the technologies and frameworks used in your project.

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - Web 3D graphics library.
- [weatherapi](https://www.weatherapi.com/) - free real-time weather tracking API.
- [Geolocation](built-in) - Browser built-in. (This API is built into most of browsers)

## Setup and Installation

!!!
Due to a private API key used, 
Please download it to your local repository and open a live server to test it locally.
(I used the vs code extension live server)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Amwaterwall/Real-Time_wallpaper.git

Usage

I will later set up the JSON file and yml file for the GitHub page (for hiding the API key), 
so Mac users can use Plash to display wallpaper on Plash.
(Plash seems to only support a single index.html file, might have to look for another platform.)

Features
Display SpongeBob's Bikini beach with light effects depending on your local time and display the local weather information. 

Future Enhancements
Add some weather effects to the scene such as rain or snowflakes particles.
Add animation to Spongebob and Patrick.
