# Real-Time_wallpaper

This is a new WebGL project from scratch, a real-time wallpaper

## Overview

The purpose of the project is to create a dynamic real-time wallpaper for Mac and window users,
where it can display the light effect depending on the user's local time and weather information.

## Technologies Used

List the technologies and frameworks used in your project.

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - Web 3D graphics library.
- [weatherapi](https://www.weatherapi.com/) - free real-time weather tracking API.
- [Geolocation](built-in) - Browser built-in. (This API is built into most of browsers)

## Setup and Installation

Due to a private API key used, 
Please download it to your local repository and open a live server to test it locally.

Note:
I will later set up the JSON file and yml file,
so mac users can use Plash to display wallpaper on Plash.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Amwaterwall/Real-Time_wallpaper.git
